# Capstone-Avery
 Capstone project for VisionOS


For my Capstone project, I made a Solar System app. The first button on the opening screen takes you to the list of planets so you can learn more about each individual planet, while the other takes you into an immersive view to see all the planets aligned together. I apologize for it being dark, I could not figure out how to add the lighting to the immersive view and it show on the models...

For my overlays this is where they were put into use (if you can provide feedback for this part in particular that would be amazing, for me personally I felt I was missing something here).

For the accessibilty, I added the labels to the text. I tried adding some of the .onAppear accessibility texts for when the app changes to a different window. Feedback/tips on how to make this better would be very much appreciated!

My 3D objects are in the Planet List and Solar System view. I used the content already in the Reality Composure Library...

Thank you!
Avery
